# Quantum Mechanical Keyboard Firmware

## Additions in this fork

This fork adds the "unpassive" keymap to the gmmk pro keyboard: qmk_firmware/keyboards/gmmk/pro/rev1/ansi/keymaps/unpassive
It also adds "unpassive" to users: qmp_firmware/users/unpassive
Both of these folders are forks of gourdo1's work

## Flashing firmware:

A tutorial on QMK with installation instructions and more can be found here: https://docs.qmk.fm/
Install QMK via the tutorial and run the "qmk setup" command
To set keyboard to gmmk pro: "qmk config user.keyboard=gmmk/pro/rev1/ansi"
To compile firmware with 4 cpu threads: "qmk compile -km unpassive -j 4"
To flash:
- Put the keyboard in bootloader mode (Unplug keyboard, then hold down Fn + \ while plugging keyboard in)
  - If you run the flash command below before putting keyboard in bootloader mode, the command will wait until it detects a keyboard in bootloader mode
- "qmk flash -km unpassive"

When changing far right column of keys (above arrow keys), sometimes the old values remain after flashing a new firmware - fn + esc clears the EEPROM which seems to then load the new buttons. Do this after flashing. I believe this is a bug with the base firmware
- This possible bug also appears to occur when changing default bool values found at the bottom of qmk_firmware/users/unpassive/unpassive.c - you must run Fn + Esc for values to take effect

## TODO:
- Update readme to show actual features: qmk_firmware/keyboards/gmmk/pro/rev1/ansi/keymaps/unpassive

This is a keyboard firmware based on the [tmk\_keyboard firmware](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard) with some useful features for Atmel AVR and ARM controllers, and more specifically, the [OLKB product line](https://olkb.com), the [ErgoDox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com) keyboard, and the [Clueboard product line](https://clueboard.co).
